# Relativistic Distortionist

<i>University of Glasgow</i>

Interactive simulation of the relativistic distortion using the lookalike-sphere construction.

<b>&beta;</b> = (&beta;<sub>x</sub>, &beta;<sub>y</sub>, &beta;<sub>z</sub>) is the simulated velocity of the viewer, in units of <i>c</i>, the speed of light.
The coordinate system is defined such that <i>x</i> points to the right, <i>y</i> upwards, and <i>z</i> into the screen.

For the simulation to be correct, the FOV of the device cameras must be set correctly.  The value entered is the wider angle of view, in degrees.
